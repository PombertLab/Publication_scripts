Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.

Members of this model includes both type I and type III restriction enzymes. Both are hetero-oligomeric proteins. Type I REs are encoded by three closely linked genes: a specificity subunit (HsdS or S) for recognizing a DNA sequence, a methylation subunit (HsdM or M) for methylating the recognized target bases, and a restriction subunit (HsdR or R) for the translocation and random cleavage of non-methylated DNA. They show diverse catalytic activities, including methyltransferase (MTase), ATP hydrolase (ATPase), DNA translocation and restriction activities. These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions: one containing 3-4 nucleotides, and another containing 4-5 nucleotides, separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6-8 nucleotides. Type III enzymes are composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognizes the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonucleases. Res is required for restriction, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognize short 5-6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25-27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Both type I and type III REs are members of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.

Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.

This activity is metal-dependent. The 5'-end of the resulting mRNA diphosphate is subsequently capped with GMP by RNA guanylytransferase, and then further modified by one or more methyltransferases. The mRNA cap-forming activity is an essential step in mRNA processing. The RTPases are not conserved among eukarya. The structure and mechanism of this fungal RTPase domain group is different from that of higher eukaryotes. This subgroup belongs to the CYTH/triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM)-like superfamily, whose enzymes have a unique active site located within an eight-stranded beta barrel. The RTPase domain of the mimivirus RTPase-GTase fusion mRNA capping enzyme also belongs to this subgroup.

Members of this model includes both type I and type III restriction enzymes. Both are hetero-oligomeric proteins. Type I REs are encoded by three closely linked genes: a specificity subunit (HsdS or S) for recognizing a DNA sequence, a methylation subunit (HsdM or M) for methylating the recognized target bases, and a restriction subunit (HsdR or R) for the translocation and random cleavage of non-methylated DNA. They show diverse catalytic activities, including methyltransferase (MTase), ATP hydrolase (ATPase), DNA translocation and restriction activities. These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions: one containing 3-4 nucleotides, and another containing 4-5 nucleotides, separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6-8 nucleotides. Type III enzymes are composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognizes the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonucleases. Res is required for restriction, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognize short 5-6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25-27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Both type I and type III REs are members of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.

Q#74 - >GPK93_06g08900	non-specific	438256	5	62	9.43609e-06	42.674	cd16594	RING-HC_TRIM7-like_C-IV	 - 	cl17238	RING finger, HC subclass, found in tripartite motif-containing proteins, TRIM7, TRIM11 and TRIM27, and similar proteins. TRIM7, TRIM11 and TRIM27, closely related tripartite motif-containing proteins, belong to the C-IV subclass of the TRIM (tripartite motif) family of proteins that are defined by their N-terminal RBCC (RING, Bbox, and coiled coil) domains, including three consecutive zinc-binding domains, a C3HC4-type RING-HC finger, Bbox2, and a coiled coil region, as well as a SPRY/B30.2 domain positioned C-terminal to the RBCC domain. TRIM7, also known as glycogenin-interacting protein (GNIP) or RING finger protein 90 (RNF90), is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates c-Jun/AP-1 activation by Ras signalling. Its phosphorylation and activation by MSK1 in response to direct activation by the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway can stimulate TRIM7 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in mediating Lys63-linked ubiquitination of the AP-1 coactivator RACO-1, leading to RACO-1 protein stabilization. Moreover, TRIM7 binds and activates glycogenin, the self-glucosylating initiator of glycogen biosynthesis. TRIM11, also known as protein BIA1, or RING finger protein 92 (RNF92), is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in the development of the central nervous system. It is overexpressed in high-grade gliomas and promotes proliferation, invasion, migration and glial tumor growth. TRIM11 acts as a potential therapeutic target for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) by mediating the degradation of CCHS-associated polyalanine-expanded Phox2b. TRIM11 modulates the function of neurogenic transcription factor Pax6 through the ubiquitin-proteosome system, and thus plays an essential role for Pax6-dependent neurogenesis. It also binds to and destabilizes a key component of the activator-mediated cofactor complex (ARC105), humanin, a neuroprotective peptide against Alzheimer's disease-relevant insults, and further regulates ARC105 function in transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling. Moreover, TRIM11 negatively regulates retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-mediated interferon-beta (IFNbeta) production and antiviral activity by targeting TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). It may contribute to the endogenous restriction of retroviruses in cells. It enhances N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) entry by interfering with Ref1 restriction. It also suppresses the early steps of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 transduction, resulting in decreased reverse transcripts. TRIM27, also known as RING finger protein 76 (RNF76), RET finger protein (RFP), or zinc finger protein RFP, is a nuclear E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is highly expressed in testis and in various tumor cell lines. Expression of TRIM27 is associated with prognosis of colon and endometrial cancers. TRIM27 was first identified as a fusion partner of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. It functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with several proteins involved in transcriptional activity, such as enhancer of polycomb 1 (Epc1), a member of the Polycomb group proteins, and Mi-2beta, a main component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma protein (RB1). It also interacts with HDAC1, leading to downregulation of thioredoxin binding protein 2 (TBP-2), which inhibits the function of thioredoxin. Moreover, TRIM27 mediates Pax7-induced ubiquitination of MyoD in skeletal muscle atrophy. In addition, it inhibits muscle differentiation by modulating serum response factor (SRF) and Epc1. TRIM27 promotes a non-canonical polyubiquitination of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that catalyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2). It is an IKKepsilon-interacting protein that regulates IkappaB kinase (IKK) function and negatively regulates signaling involved in the antiviral response and inflammation. TRIM27 also forms a protein complex with MBD4 or MBD2 or MBD3, and thus plays an important role in the enhancement of transcriptional repression through MBD proteins in tumorigenesis, spermatogenesis, and embryogenesis. It is a component of an estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) regulatory complex that is involved in estrogen receptor-mediated transcription in MCF-7 cells.

Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.

PCGF6, also known as Mel18 and Bmi1-like RING finger (MBLR), or RING finger protein 134 (RNF134), is one of six PcG RING finger (PCGF) homologs (PCGF1/NSPc1, PCGF2/Mel-18, PCGF3, PCGF4/BMI1, PCGF5, and PCGF6/MBLR). It serves as the core component of a noncanonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)-like L3MBTL2 complex, which is composed of some canonical components, such as RNF2, CBX3, CXB4, CXB6, CXB7, and CXB8, as well as some noncanonical components, such as L3MBTL2, E2F6, WDR5, HDAC1, and RYBP, and plays a critical role in epigenetic transcriptional silencing in higher eukaryotes. Like other PCGF homologs, PCGF6 possesses the transcriptional repression activity, and also associates with ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) to form a RNF2-PCGF heterodimer, which is catalytically competent as an E3 ubiquitin transferase and is the scaffold for the assembly of additional components. Moreover, PCGF6 can regulate the enzymatic activity of JARID1d/KDM5D, a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase, through direct interaction. Furthermore, PCGF6 is expressed predominantly in meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells and may play important roles in mammalian male germ cell development. It also regulates mesodermal lineage differentiation in mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and functions in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) reprogramming. The activity of PCGF6 is found to be regulated by cell cycle dependent phosphorylation. PCGF6 contains a C3HC4-type RING-HC finger.

This model represents a family of methyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of menaquinone and ubiqinone. Some members such as the UbiE enzyme from E. coli are believed to act in both pathways, while others may act in only the menaquinone pathway. These methyltransferases are members of the UbiE/CoQ family of methyltransferases (pfam01209) which also contains ubiquinone methyltransferases and other methyltransferases. Members of this clade include a wide distribution of bacteria and eukaryotes, but no archaea. An outgroup for this clade is provided by the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.17) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

This superfamily uses S-AdoMet (S-adenosyl-L-methionine or SAM) in the methylation of diverse substrates. Most members catalyze various methylation steps in cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis. There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. The enzymes involved in the aerobic pathway are prefixed Cob and those of the anaerobic pathway Cbi. Most of the enzymes are shared by both pathways and a few enzymes are pathway-specific. Diphthine synthase and ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase I (RsmI) are two superfamily members that are not involved in cobalamin biosynthesis. Diphthine synthase participates in the posttranslational modification of a specific histidine residue in elongation factor 2 (EF-2) of eukaryotes and archaea to diphthamide. RsmI catalyzes the 2-O-methylation of the ribose of cytidine 1402 (C1402) in 16S rRNA. Other superfamily members not involved in cobalamin biosynthesis include the N-terminal tetrapyrrole methylase domain of Bacillus subtilis YabN whose specific function is unknown, and Omphalotus olearius omphalotin methyltransferase which catalyzes the automethylation of its own C-terminus; this C terminus is subsequently released and macrocyclized to give Omphalotin A, a potent nematicide.
